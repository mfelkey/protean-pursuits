You are the Frontend Developer for the following project. Using the documents below,
produce a complete Frontend Implementation Report (FIR) with working code for all
key components and pages.

--- Technical Implementation Plan (excerpt) ---

--- User Experience Document (excerpt) ---
{uxd_content}

--- Backend Implementation Report (excerpt) ---

--- UI Content Guide (excerpt) ---
{content_guide}

Produce a complete Frontend Implementation Report (FIR) with ALL of the following sections:

1. PROJECT SETUP
   - Next.js app initialization (App Router)
   - Directory structure for frontend
   - TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
   - ESLint and Prettier configuration
   - Environment variable setup

2. COMPONENT LIBRARY
   - Complete implementation of every shared component:
     * KPICard component (with tooltip, ARIA)
     * FilterBar component (with all filters from UXD)
     * DataTable component (sortable, keyboard navigable)
     * Chart components (BarChart, LineChart using Recharts)
     * Modal component (focus trap, Esc to close)
     * Toast notification component (aria-live)
     * LoadingSpinner component (with accessible label)
     * ErrorBanner component
   - Each component: full TypeScript code, props interface, ARIA annotations

3. PAGE IMPLEMENTATIONS
   - Executive Summary page (KPI cards + overview charts)
   - Detailed View page (filters + data table + charts)
   - Trip Detail modal
   - Error/Not Authorized page
   - Help page
   - Each page: full Next.js page code with data fetching

4. STATE MANAGEMENT
   - Filter state management (persistent in URL hash)
   - User session state
   - Toast notification state
   - Loading state management
   - Implementation using React context or Zustand

5. API INTEGRATION LAYER
   - API client setup (fetch wrapper with auth headers)
   - Type definitions for all API responses
   - Error handling for all API calls
   - Loading state management per request
   - Complete hooks for each endpoint (useTrips, useTripDetail, useExport)

6. ACCESSIBILITY IMPLEMENTATION
   - Skip navigation link
   - Focus management after async operations
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
   - Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
   - Color contrast verification notes

7. UI CONTENT INTEGRATION
   - How UI content strings are organized (constants file)
   - Complete strings constants file with all labels, tooltips,
     error messages, button text from the UI Content Guide
   - No hardcoded strings anywhere in components

8. EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY
   - CSV export implementation
   - PDF export implementation
   - PHI masking in exports
   - Download handling

9. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
   - Auth0 integration in Next.js
   - Protected route middleware
   - Token storage and refresh
   - PHI field masking in components

10. UNIT TESTS
    - Component tests using React Testing Library
    - Hook tests
    - Accessibility tests using jest-axe
    - Mock API responses

Output the complete FIR as well-formatted markdown with working TypeScript/React code.
All code must be production-ready, fully typed, and Section 508 compliant.
UI copy must match the UI Content Guide exactly — no improvised strings.
