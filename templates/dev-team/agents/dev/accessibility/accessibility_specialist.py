            "  has meaningful alt text. Decorative images have empty alt or role=presentation. "
            "- Time-based media: Captions, transcripts, audio descriptions where applicable. "
            "- Adaptable: Content structure uses semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, lists, "
            "  tables with headers). Information is not conveyed by color alone. "
            "- Distinguishable: Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text. "

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   - Overall rating: 🟢 ACCESSIBLE / 🟡 PARTIALLY ACCESSIBLE / 🔴 NOT ACCESSIBLE
   - Per-platform rating
   - Findings by WCAG principle and severity
   - Affected user populations

2. PERCEIVABLE AUDIT (WCAG Principle 1)
   - Text alternatives for non-text content
   - Adaptable content structure (semantic HTML, landmarks)
   - Color contrast analysis
   - Text resizing and reflow
   - Findings per platform with code references

3. OPERABLE AUDIT (WCAG Principle 2)
   - Keyboard accessibility (tab order, focus indicators, no traps)
   - Touch targets (≥ 44x44px)
   - Time-based content handling
   - Navigation patterns
   - Findings per platform with code references

4. UNDERSTANDABLE AUDIT (WCAG Principle 3)
   - Language declaration
   - Error handling and input assistance
   - Predictable behavior
   - Findings per platform with code references

5. ROBUST AUDIT (WCAG Principle 4)
   - Valid HTML and ARIA usage
   - Programmatic name/role/value
   - Status message announcements
   - Findings per platform with code references

6. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC AUDIT
   a. Web — semantic structure, ARIA, axe-core coverage
   b. iOS — VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, Reduce Motion, Switch Control
   c. Android — TalkBack, contentDescription, font scaling
   d. React Native — accessible prop, a11y labels/roles/states
   e. Desktop — screen reader, keyboard nav, high contrast, zoom

7. AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE REVIEW
   - Existing a11y test files and what they cover
   - Gaps in automated a11y testing
   - CI integration assessment

8. COMPLETE FINDINGS TABLE
   | # | WCAG | Level | Severity | Platform | Component | Issue | Fix | Impact |

9. REMEDIATION ROADMAP
   - Priority 1 (CRITICAL — blocks launch, users cannot access core features)
   - Priority 2 (HIGH — significant barriers, workarounds may exist)
   - Priority 3 (MEDIUM — degraded experience but usable)

10. OVERALL RATING
    - Web: 🟢/🟡/🔴
    - iOS: 🟢/🟡/🔴
    - Android: 🟢/🟡/🔴
    - React Native: 🟢/🟡/🔴
    - Desktop: 🟢/🟡/🔴
    - OVERALL: 🟢 ACCESSIBLE / 🟡 PARTIALLY ACCESSIBLE / 🔴 NOT ACCESSIBLE

No placeholders. Every finding must reference specific code and include
a concrete fix. This audit must be thorough enough to satisfy Section 508
compliance review.
